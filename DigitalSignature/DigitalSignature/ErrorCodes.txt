C_Initialize

    CKR_ARGUMENTS_BAD = This is a rather generic error code which indicates that
                        the arguments supplied to the Cryptoki function were in some way not appropriate.

    CKR_CANT_LOCK = This value can only be returned by C_Initialize. It means that the type of locking 
                    requested by the application for thread-safety is not available in this library, 
                    and so the application cannot make use of this library in the specified fashion.

    CKR_CRYPTOKI_ALREADY_INITIALIZED = This value can only be returned by C_Initialize.
                                       It means that the Cryptoki library has already been initialized 
                                       (by a previous call to C_Initialize which did not have a matching C_Finalize call)

	CKR_FUNCTION_FAILED = The requested function could not be performed, but detailed information about why not 
                          is not available in this error return.  If the failed function uses a session, it is possible that 
                          the CK_SESSION_INFO structure that can be obtained by calling C_GetSessionInfo will hold useful information
                          about what happened in its ulDeviceError field.  In any event, although the function call failed, the situation is not 
                          necessarily totally hopeless, as it is likely to be when CKR_GENERAL_ERROR is returned. Depending on what the root 
                          cause of the error actually was, it is possible that an attempt to make the exact same function call again would succeed.

	CKR_GENERAL_ERROR = Some horrible, unrecoverable error has occurred. In the worst case, it is possible that 
                        the function only partially succeeded, and that the computer and/or token is in an inconsistent state.

	CKR_HOST_MEMORY = The computer that the Cryptoki library is running on has insufficient memory to perform the requested function.

	CKR_NEED_TO_CREATE_THREADS = This value can only be returned by C_Initialize. It is returned when two conditions hold:
                                 1. The application called C_Initialize in a way which tells the Cryptoki library that application 
                                    threads executing calls to the library cannot use native operating system methods to spawn new threads.
                                 2. The library cannot function properly without being able to spawn new threads in the above fashion.

                              token and/or library permits. For example, if some application has an open SO session, and another 
                              application attempts to log the normal user into a session, the attempt may return this error. 
                              It is not required to, however.  Only if the simultaneous distinct users cannot be supported 
                              does C_Login have to return this value.  Note that this error code generalizes to true multi-user tokens.

    CKR_USER_TYPE_INVALID = An invalid value was specified as a CK_USER_TYPE. Valid types are CKU_SO, CKU_USER, and CKU_CONTEXT_SPECIFIC.

    CKR_DEVICE_REMOVED = The token was removed from its slot during the execution of the function.

    CKR_FUNCTION_FAILED = The requested function could not be performed, but detailed information about why not 
                          is not available in this error return.

    CKR_GENERAL_ERROR = Some horrible, unrecoverable error has occurred. In the worst case, it is possible that 
                        the function only partially succeeded, and that the computer and/or token is in an inconsistent state. 

    CKR_HOST_MEMORY = The computer that the Cryptoki library is running on has insufficient memory to perform the requested function.

    CKR_SESSION_CLOSED = The session was closed during the execution of the function.

    CKR_SESSION_HANDLE_INVALID = The specified session handle was invalid at the time that the function was invoked.
                                 An example of multiple threads accessing a common session simultaneously is where 
                                 one thread is using a session when another thread closes that same session.

    <-
    CKR_USER_NOT_LOGGED_IN = The desired action cannot be performed because the appropriate user is not logged in.

C_SignInit

    CKR_ARGUMENTS_BAD = This is a rather generic error code which indicates that the arguments 
                        supplied to the Cryptoki function were in some way not appropriate.

    CKR_CRYPTOKI_NOT_INITIALIZED = Cryptoki library has not yet been initialized by a call to C_Initialize.

    CKR_DEVICE_MEMORY = The token does not have sufficient memory to perform the requested function.

    <-
    CKR_DEVICE_REMOVED = The token was removed from its slot during the execution of the function.

    CKR_FUNCTION_CANCELED = The function was canceled in mid-execution. This happens to a cryptographic function 
                            if the function makes a CKN_SURRENDER application callback which returns CKR_CANCEL. 
                            It also happens to a function that performs PIN entry through a protected path. 
                            The method used to cancel a protected path PIN entry operation is device dependent.

    CKR_FUNCTION_FAILED = The requested function could not be performed, but detailed information about why not 
                          is not available in this error return.

    CKR_GENERAL_ERROR = Some horrible, unrecoverable error has occurred. In the worst case, it is possible that

    CKR_HOST_MEMORY = The computer that the Cryptoki library is running on has insufficient memory to perform the requested function.

    <-
    CKR_KEY_FUNCTION_NOT_PERMITTED = An attempt has been made to use a key for a cryptographic purpose that the key’s attributes are not 
                                     set to allow it to do. For example, to use a key for performing encryption, that key MUST have its 
                                     CKA_ENCRYPT attribute set to CK_TRUE (the fact that the key MUST have a CKA_ENCRYPT attribute implies 
                                     that the key cannot be a private key). This return value has lower priority than CKR_KEY_TYPE_INCONSISTENT.

    CKR_KEY_HANDLE_INVALID = The specified key handle is not valid. It may be the case that the specified handle is a valid 
                             handle for an object which is not a key.  We reiterate here that 0 is never a valid key handle.

    <-
    CKR_KEY_SIZE_RANGE = Although the requested keyed cryptographic operation could in principle be carried out, this Cryptoki 
                         library (or the token) is unable to actually do it because the supplied key‘s size is outside 
                         the range of key sizes that it can handle.
    
    <-
    CKR_KEY_TYPE_INCONSISTENT = The specified key is not the correct type of key to use with the specified mechanism.
                                This return value has a higher priority than CKR_KEY_FUNCTION_NOT_PERMITTED.

    <-
    CKR_MECHANISM_INVALID = An invalid mechanism was specified to the cryptographic operation. 
                            This error code is an appropriate return value if an unknown mechanism was specified 
                            or if the mechanism specified cannot be used in the selected token with the selected function.

    <-
    CKR_MECHANISM_PARAM_INVALID = Invalid parameters were supplied to the mechanism specified to the cryptographic operation. 
                                  Which parameter values are supported by a given mechanism can vary from token to token.

    <-
    CKR_OPERATION_ACTIVE = There is already an active operation (or combination of active operations) which prevents 
                           Cryptoki from activating the specified operation.

    <-
    CKR_PIN_EXPIRED = The specified PIN has expired, and the requested operation cannot be carried out unless C_SetPIN is called 
                      to change the PIN value. Whether or not the normal user’s PIN on a token ever expires varies from token to token.

    CKR_SESSION_CLOSED = The session was closed during the execution of the function. An example of multiple threads accessing
                         a common session simultaneously is where one thread is using a session when another thread closes that same session.

    CKR_SESSION_HANDLE_INVALID = The specified session handle was invalid at the time that the function was invoked.

    CKR_ARGUMENTS_BAD = This is a rather generic error code which indicates that the arguments 
                        supplied to the Cryptoki function were in some way not appropriate.

    CKR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL = The output of the function is too large to fit in the supplied buffer.

    CKR_CRYPTOKI_NOT_INITIALIZED = Cryptoki library has not yet been initialized by a call to C_Initialize.

    <-
    CKR_DATA_INVALID = The plaintext input data to a cryptographic operation is invalid. 
                       This return value has lower priority than CKR_DATA_LEN_RANGE.

    <-
    CKR_DATA_LEN_RANGE = The plaintext input data to a cryptographic operation has a bad length. 
                         Depending on the operation’s mechanism, this could mean that the plaintext data is too short, too long, 
                         or is not a multiple of some particular block size. This return value has higher priority than CKR_DATA_INVALID.

    <-

    CKR_HOST_MEMORY = The computer that the Cryptoki library is running on has insufficient memory to perform the requested function.

    CKR_OPERATION_NOT_INITIALIZED = There is no active operation of an appropriate type in the specified session.
                                    For example, an application cannot call C_Encrypt in a session without having 
                                    called C_EncryptInit first to activate an encryption operation.
